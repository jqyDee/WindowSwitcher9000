# Description
This is a small but fast and I hope reliable window switcher (basically an alternative to alt tab). Text based and not program bound. So way faster than you tapping away at your CMD + TAB.

*Unfortunately this program is only possible through yabai, a tiling window manager*
_this is because macos does not find it necessary to make all the windows across all the spaces accessible to the user_

# Setup
The Setup is really simple. Only thing that you might have to do, is change the path to yabai. Goodluck!
